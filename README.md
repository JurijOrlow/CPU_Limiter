# CPU_Limiter

Limiting maximum CPU usage can be benefitial, as it can reduce heat generated by your CPU in times when you don't need its full power. But if you want to use full power again changing it back requires a bit of a hustle.

Here CPU Limiter comes into play. Simply open it, choose whatever limit you want (currently available 100%, 70%, 50% and 30%) and done.
